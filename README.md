# Energy Efficient Operation of Network Elements with Stepwise Power Profile

Due to the rising demand to reduce the energy consumption, modern network elements (will) have the ability to energise and de-energise subsystems on command as the network element’s traffic data rate varies. This results in stepwise power profiles. A “Minimal Power Principle” is described and applied to construct simple look-up table indicating the number and type of sub-systems to energise to minimise the overall power consumption of a network element with modular power management. 

This script implements the **Minimal Power Principle**, a method to determine the optimal combination of active subsystems that minimises total power consumption for a given traffic load. The principle is applied to construct a **simple look-up table** indicating the number and type of subsystems to activate in a modularly powered network element.

The generated figures and results illustrate how energy-efficient operation can be achieved under stepwise power constraints.
